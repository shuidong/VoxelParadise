Blenderizer - Object focused editor camera
v1.0.1 - Released 03/09/2014 by Alan Baylis
----------------------------------------


Foreword
----------------------------------------
Thank you for checking out Blenderizer. This handy little utility gives a Blender like feel to the Unity Editor.


Notes
----------------------------------------
The first thing to do is drag the folder named 'Editor Default Resources' from the main folder and drag it to the root of the Assets folder in your project. This will add a small icon next to the title on the tab for the window the next time Unity starts.

Some of the features are active all of the time like the mouse wheel movement and the numkeys but others functions require you to right click on an object to enter Blenderizer mode.


To-do List.
----------------------------------------
Keyboard mapping of Unity hotkeys.
Sliders to adjust the speed of movement etc.
